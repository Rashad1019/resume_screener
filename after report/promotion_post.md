**Headline:** Building my own AI Recruiter with Python & Gemini 🚀

I just engaged in a fun weekend build: an **AI Resume Screener** that automates the candidate evaluation process.

Inspired by a tutorial from Aman Kharwal, I adapted the concept to use **Google's Gemini API** for faster, cloud-based inference and added some powerful new features:

✅ **Batch Processing:** Screen an entire folder of PDFs in one click.  
✅ **Dynamic Role Generation:** Type a job title, and the AI writes the Job Description for you.  
✅ **Semantic Matching:** It understands that "Python" + "Pandas" = Data Science skills.

The tool parses PDF resumes, compares them against strict criteria, and outputs a Match Score (0-100) with a detailed reasoning report.

It's a great example of how accessible Agentic AI has become. No complex training required—just smart prompt engineering and solid Python logic.

Fed up with manual review? This Python script reads PDF resumes and uses Google Gemini to score them against any job description.

New features added:
1️⃣ Batch mode (Screen 50 resumes at once)
2️⃣ Auto-generate Job Descriptions

Big thanks to Aman Kharwal for the original inspiration!
